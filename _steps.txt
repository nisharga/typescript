************** TypeScript Vs es6 *****************************
everything is same to same, but only difference is ": string" this line.
let student: string = 'nisharga';
when we use es6, we use let student = 'nisharga';
but in typeScript.... let student: string = 'nisharga';

let age: number = 10;
let isSmart: boolean = false;

let presedent: string[] = ['jho', 'baidan', 'Love', 'hope'];
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

when object or array this type of things happen.....
const person: {name: string, age: number, job: string} = { name: "Nisharga", age: 20, job: 'kaj nai' }

then smartest method this is......................

interface Kaj{ title: string;<br bill: number; suti: boolean; } const kaj: Kaj ={ title: "Boss", bill: 2200, suti : false, }
**************** using UseState **********************
interface User{ name: string; job: string; }

const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null); const handleIncrise = (): void=> { setCounter(counter + 1); }
const handleUserSubmit = (e : any) => { e.preventDefault(); const userdata = { name: "Nisharga", job: "Bekar", } setUser(userdata); }
Add User

************************ Using Props ******************
(HOMEPAGE)

const Person = ({name, age}: { name: any; age: any; }) => { return(
Person name is {name} and age is {age}
); }
Alternative option interface Props{ name: string; age: number; } const Person: FC = ({name, age}) => {}
